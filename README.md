## My process

### Built with

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have just started learning how to include TailwindCSS into my projects. I thought I'd try a Frontend Mentor challenge to get some practice with setting up Tailwind in a project and using it for my styles. I also did some configuration to adjust some of the classes to work better for the designs in this challenge.

### Continued development

I will keep practicing with Tailwind and implement it into some larger projects.

### Useful resources
